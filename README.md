# Leaf-Disease-Detection-CNN
About This work presents a simple CNN-based technique for early detection of tomato leaf disease using 22948 images from the New Plant Diseases Dataset. The proposed model has a training accuracy of 97.6% and a test accuracy of 93.6%, making it an efficient and effective tool for farmers to identify and mitigate losses due to tomato leaf disease.
